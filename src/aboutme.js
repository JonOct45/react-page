        <h2>This is About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Jonathan McGrath, and I live in San Francisco CA.
          This is going to be my about me where I put information about myself, and
          this information will range from personal to professional.

          It also could contain information about different locations I've lived and
          places I've been.

          Maybe it'll have information about animals and the ocean. . Who knows?!

        </p>

            In 2007, I joined the United States Navy and joined as a Sonar Technician deployed on US Submarines. I was
            stationed in Groton, Connecticut and later in San Diego, California upon the USS Topeka (SSN 754).
